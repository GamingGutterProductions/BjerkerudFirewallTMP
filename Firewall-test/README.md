# bjerkerudFirewall

## Overview

The bjerkerudFirewall project is a free network firewall distribution, based on the FreeBSD operating system with a custom kernel and including third party free software packages for additional functionality. bjerkerudFirewall software, with the help of the package system, is able to provide the same functionality or more of common commercial firewalls, without any of the artificial limitations. It has successfully replaced every big name commercial firewall you can imagine in numerous installations around the world, including Check Point, Cisco PIX, Cisco ASA, Juniper, Sonicwall, Netgear, Watchguard, Astaro, and more.

bjerkerudFirewall software includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components. There is no need for any UNIX knowledge, no need to use the command line for anything, and no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Users familiar with commercial firewalls catch on to the web interface quickly, though there can be a learning curve for users not familiar with commercial-grade firewalls.

bjerkerudFirewall started in 2004 as a fork of the [m0n0wall](http://m0n0.ch/wall/index.php "m0n0wall project homepage") Project (which ended 2015/02/15), though has diverged significantly since.
